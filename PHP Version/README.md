PHP Version
===============

I have made a PHP version of the coursework since it is my native programming language. Don't worry about the code here, I'm just using it to do some tests with the Java coursework in my preferred language.

If you are reading this, then we need to still think of a scenario!


To run this, type in command line "php index.php" (be in the correct directory, obviously).
